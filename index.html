                My name is Emily M. Stewart, I am 24 years old and currently live in Tucson, AZ. I was born in California and raised in Alabama for a majority of my life. I joined the United States Airforce as a Weapons Load Crew member after I turned 18, I have now been enlisted for 6 years but do not plan on making it a career. I have traveled to over 15 states and 4 different countries, got stationed in South Korea and now Arizona. I am currently studying for my associates in Video Game Simulation and Design with a concentration of programming but I hope to transfer my credits over and persue my Bachelors in Computer Science.
                Some hobbies of mine include drawing/creating concept art and comics, working out, swimming, and playing video games. I am a huge fan of Science fiction, Fantasy, Superhero, and Horror genres, essentially anything that can get my brain wondering I tend to gravitate towards that.
